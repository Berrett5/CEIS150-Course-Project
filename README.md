# CEIS150-Course-Project

A multi‑module Python project demonstrating object‑oriented programming, inheritance, data analysis, file handling, GUI development, and stock market data visualization.

📌 Project Overview
This project was developed across multiple modules in CEIS150 and showcases a full progression from basic Python OOP concepts to a complete stock‑tracking application with a GUI and data visualization.

The project includes:

Object‑Oriented Programming fundamentals

Class design and UML diagrams

Inheritance and polymorphism

Unit testing

Text‑based user interfaces

File handling and data persistence

Data visualization using matplotlib

Web scraping and historical stock data import

A full GUI application for stock tracking

🛠️ Software & Tools Used
IDE: VS Code

Python Libraries:

matplotlib

sqlite3

Iterators & Generators

Add‑Ons:

SQLite

Live Share

Git

Other Software:

Microsoft Visio (UML diagrams)

Microsoft Excel (data import)

📚 Module Breakdown
🧩 Module 1 — Environment Setup
Installed Python, VS Code, and required extensions

Verified Python environment with a successful test run

Prepared the workspace for the stock tracking application

🧩 Module 2 — Classes, UML, and Unit Testing
✔ UML Class Diagrams
Created initial class diagrams using Microsoft Visio.

✔ Class Coding
Converted UML diagrams into Python class implementations.

✔ Unit Testing
Wrote unit tests to validate class behavior.
Included screenshots of successful test results.

🧩 Module 3 — Text‑Based User Interface
Developed a console‑based interface to:

Add stocks

List stocks

Add daily stock data (date, price, volume)

Generate summary reports

This module introduced user interaction and data entry.

🧩 Module 4 — Inheritance
Expanded the project using inheritance:

Added new classes derived from base stock classes

Implemented investment account features

Updated unit tests to validate inherited behavior

🧩 Module 5 — Data Visualization
Integrated matplotlib to generate stock price charts.

Pressing option 5 in the menu displays a plotted graph

Visualizes stock price history over time

🧩 Module 6 — Loading Historical Data
Downloaded historical stock data from Yahoo! Finance

Imported Excel data into the Python program

Added menu option 7 to load historical data into the system

🧩 Module 7 — Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Built a full GUI version of the stock tracking program.

GUI Features:
Add and manage stocks

View historical data

Import Yahoo! Finance data

Generate reports

Display charts inside the GUI

Screenshots show the GUI, History tab, and Report tab in action.

📈 Key Features of the Final Application
Object‑oriented design with multiple classes

Inheritance and polymorphism

Data persistence using files

Stock price visualization

Historical data import

GUI interface for improved usability

Unit testing for reliability
